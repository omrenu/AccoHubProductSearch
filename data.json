      "description": "Cyber Security Industry is growing at a brisk pace. A good percentage of this growth can be attributed to the technological advancement but at the same time a small portion of it can be attributed to the fear of the unknowns. With this rapid pace of growth came the new set of challenges like new tools, technologies, regulations, operation models etc. This is all good but “No one size fits all”. Each business has a unique set of needs. In cyber terms this would mean establishing a measure for the organization's unique risk posture and adaptability requirements first before spending hard fought budget dollars while also drawing maximum value from existing investments. CRGS (An Accolite venture) is focused on providing custom solutions to its end customers.",
